# Test Plan

1. Check that folder buttons open correct folders

2. Place XML threads in the ThreadKeeper folder and check that Force sync copies them to the Fusion 360 folder.

   Example thread files: [Fusion-360-FDM-threads](https://github.com/dans98/Fusion-360-FDM-threads)

3. Remove the added threads from the Fusion 360 folder and restart Fusion 360. Check that the ThreadKeeper dialog message is shown and that the threads are restored.

4. Check that the installed threads can be used in Fusion 360.

5. Wait for a Fusion 360 update and check that ThreadKeeper dialog message is shown and that the threads are restored.

   This step cannot easily be performed at will.
